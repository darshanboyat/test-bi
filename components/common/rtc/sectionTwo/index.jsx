Admin, Travel Agent and Customer are the three main user roles in this application. With intuitive subscription packages, the travel agent can use the platform for creating and executing a complete travel plan for their customers. As since the platform is dealing with multiple data types and large amounts of details, we have used smart layouts to represent the data in the form of graphs, charts, KPI's. Admin and Travel agents can also modify the parameters and see the data they want to see over the charts. It is fully customisable which helps to focus on the main parameters which are important for the travel industry business and saves time in analyzing the details. To make it user-friendly for the customers (travellers) we have added a mobile app so that they can receive timely notification and updates for all their travel plans and itineraries.</p>
