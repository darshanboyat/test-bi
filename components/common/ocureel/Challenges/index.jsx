Also, we added MLM principals in the referral program and the leaderboard for weekly payouts to the users. Both features made the logic and algorithm highly dense and complex to work upon.</p>

            <p className='opacity-50 text-lg'>Advanced-level code optimization, breaking the video into smaller frames, connecting them and then showing them as a whole to the end user for much faster loading. To resolve and keeping the algorithm scalable, we divided the points into the category which made the calculations simple. Plus integrated weekly payout automated formulas lead to lesser time consumption.</p>
