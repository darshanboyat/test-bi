                As it gets tougher for design thinkers and developers to get users to find and download apps, you ‘have’ to think about engagement; in order to make your mobile app design relevant, valued and useful so it delights and hence retains user. Time and again, we put ourselves in the end-users shoes to empathize and feel the experience, be it iOS apps or Android application. From content curation, pixel-perfection to intuitive micro-interactions, we leave no stone unturned to build an app that engages.
