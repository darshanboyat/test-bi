        "Custom web design isn’t just about the visuals of your website – it’s an in-depth process to understand your business and create a comprehensive digital presence to bring success. Our approach involves learning about you, devising a strategy, creating a great user experience, designing the website and programming it accordingly, as well as implementing marketing tactics. All aspects are meticulously crafted to help you reach your organizational objectives and ensure you get the best ROI.",

We believe in transparency and flexibility, so any feedback or suggestions you have for reaching your desired goals are more than welcome. Even once it has been custom-built and is live, you can still keep an eye on it from the back end.",

  const para1 = "While it’s true that you can use custom solutions to build a unique website, the way your business needs to be structured and the features your customers are looking for will determine whether or not using a custom solution is necessary. If you own a restaurant, for example, you don’t need much. A simple website featuring your menu, team overview, location, and contact information would probably be enough. But if you are looking for something that will help your restaurant to stand out (and not just from a design standpoint), then a custom approach is the way to go."

  const para2 = "If it doesn’t have the elements of being working, engaging, and interactive, it’s not a good web design. Brain Inventory’s custom web design service is committed to that. Our process is unlike other creative agencies since we first focus on getting the answers to important questions."
