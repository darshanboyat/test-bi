      description:
        "Swift has many advantages over Objective-C and other languages, but the major advantage comes in the form of interactivity. The most apparent benefit is in the availability of a REPL (read-eval-print-loop), which makes debugging easier and gives you instant feedback on errors.",

        "Swift is a beautiful, modern programming language. It supports high-level object-oriented programs along with functional programming and structured mathematics. The main feature of Swift is that it uses functional programming patterns like Map/Filter, in addition, to supporting high-level data structures (via protocol and extension), the addition of type inference, and runtime error handling.",

It all depends on various factors like the development platform, the complexity of the design, the experience level of the developer, features, and functionality, testing, and many more.

The syntax is cleaner, there are fewer parentheses and brackets to keep track of, and most methods are defined outside their parent class or function.",
    "Maintaining code is challenging in many ways. But in the case of Swift apps, maintaining a single code base is much easier because it’s integrated into a single file. This makes it simpler to make changes and iterate easily on your app.",
